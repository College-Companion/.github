# College Companion

The official GitHub organization for all College Companion related projects. Check out [www.collegecompanion.app](www.collegecompanion.app) for the official website.

## History of the College Companion

The College Companion started out as the [College Selector](www.collegeselector.app), a mobile application to support students applying and looking at University to narrow down their search. While the College Selector was originally a spreadsheet, a mobile application was created in React Native in 2017 with the goal of reaching more users. In the autumn of 2021, the mobile application was taken off of the Apple App Store as it wasn't being updated and maintained. This provided a perfect opportunity to begin redoing and revamping the project as more of a Companion application to support individuals going into University and staying throughout their journey in University. The features of the College Selector have been merged into this project with new additional features being added to separate it from its predecessor.

## Features

The College Companion contains two major elements; a set of Pre-College Tools and a set of College Tools. The Pre-College Tools consist of the features from the College Selector with some additional features. These features include the original College Selector, a College Acceptance Rate Calculator, Tour Questions to ask while on a tour of a University, and Discussion Questions to help support conversations between guardians and students. The College Tools component consists of tools to support students in University. These tools consist of a Four Year Plan and a GPA Calculator. More features will be added.
